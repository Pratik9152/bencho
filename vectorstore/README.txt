3. ATTENDANCE/OFFICE HOURS
The  standard  office  time  for  Head  Office  adopted  by  IRClass  is  9.00  am  to  5.30  p.m.  The  Saturday
roaster duty system for Head Office is discontinued w.e.f. 1st April 2017. 
However,  flexi  timing  norms  for  attendance  are  applicable  for  Head  Office  considering  the
inconvenience  that  employees  sometimes  face  while  commuting  in  a  metropolitan  city  like  Mumbai.
Nevertheless    these  flexi  timing  norms  are  not  to  be  implied  as  benefits  /  rights.  These  are  the
flexibilities given to help us manage our attendance in situations which are beyond a normal control. 
   
Since  IRClass  is  a  technical  and  a  customer  oriented  Organization,  all  employees  are  expected  to
ensure  high  quality/timely  customer  services.  All  employees  are  requested  to  adhere  to  the  office
timings and also go beyond the normal working hours if required. Kindly ensure that on no account our
services to the clients are delayed/compromised/hindered in any manner whatsoever especially due to
client request or requirement made on a Saturday.

Basic Rules
The revised flexi timing norms w.e.f. 1st July 2019 are as follows;
 
Employees must be present during the core working hours of the organization which is 10:00 am to
5:00  pm.  Employees  coming  to  office  after  10:00  am  or  leaving  office  before  5:00  pm  should  take
prior  approval  from  HOD/DH.  The  calculation  of  working  hours  will  be  considered  from  8:45  am  to
7:00 pm. Punch in time before 8:45 am and punch out time after 7:00 pm will not be considered in
calculation of working hours.
The working hours on all working days are 8:30 hrs. 
It is mandatory for an employee to complete 42.30 hours in a week (Monday – Friday). This excludes
public holidays or leaves availed in that particular  week.
Daily working hours of less than 7.00 hrs will be treated as half day leave and less than 4:15 hrs will
be treated as full day leave.
Reporting  office  after  11.30  a.m.  will  be  considered  as  half  day  and  similarly  leaving  office  before
3.45 p.m. will be treated as half day. Only in case of any exigency an employee can leave early after
taking  due  permission  from  HOD/DH.(However,half  day  leave  will  be  deducted  for  working  hours
less than 7 hours in a day).
Half day calculation – minimum working hrs for half day is 4.15 hrs from the punch in time. 1st half is
till 1:00 pm and 2nd half starts from 1:30 pm.  
Deduction for shortfall of weekly working hours –  
Half day leave will be deducted for every shortfall of completion of weekly working hours of up to 1 hour.
Thereafter, for every shortfall of 1 hour, further half day leave will  be deducted. Example: If an employee
completes only 40.45 hours in a week, then 1 day leave will be deducted from his/her leave balance.    
Missing  attendance  reported  through  our  auto-email  system  must  be  regularized  within  working  days
with proper approvals from HOD/DH on any day. 
All such deduction of leaves/adjustment will be first done against CSL. In case the CSL gets exhausted,
the deductions/adjustments will be done against PL. Further if  PL is exhausted then such deduction will
be considered as  LWP (leave without pay).
 
Flexibility in the attendance policy or working hours is solely at the discretion of the management and it
cannot  be  claimed  as  a  matter  of  right.  Only  in  case  of  any  exigency  or  any  kind  of  emergency  an
employee may avail the flexi hours after taking due permission from HOD/DH.

It  is  recommended  that  employee  should  check  his/her  attendance  time  on  regular  basis  and
monitor the same.   
Important points to note: 
·        
Flexi time is a facility given to manage unforeseen situation of office attendance and not to be treated
as benefit. 
Employee must regularly update their outdoor duty / Outstation Duty in the ESS.
In  case  due  to  any  biological  reasons  (damaged  skin  /  Mehndi/tattoo  applied  on  finger  /  finger  print
not  readable  by  machine  etc),  if  the  attendance  is  not  getting  registered,  please  immediately  inform
Ms.  Shweta  Gore  /  Mr.  Kazi  with  proper  approval  from  your  HOD/DH.  One  may  also  maintain  a
 
manual attendance in the attendance register kept in HR Dept.  
All other norms of ESS as per Leave management Module will remain unchanged. 
Late Mark waiver has been removed from the System.
It  may  please  be  noted  that  the  leave  register  of  a  particular  month  will  be  kept  open  for  any
updations  in  the  system  till  15th  of  next  month.  However  as  a  good  practice,  all  employees  are
requested to update/regularize the attendance immediately after they get a system alert for missing
attendance. 
Employees are requested to check their attendance every month and regularize the same wherever
applicable by 5th of subsequent Month. Each month a report shall be generated from the system on
or before 15th of every month for the attendance of previous month and accordingly leave deduction
will be considered for Salary processing.

      Sr.Vice President & Company Secretary.
For any queries / non-registration of attendance, following personnel should be contacted;

PROCEDURE
Issue No.: 3 Version No.: 1.4
P-17 

Procedure:
Oral Warning
The  HOD/HoSS  should  inform  the  employee  of  the  nature  of  the  unsatisfactory  performance  and
indicate  the  improvement  expected  in  a  face-to-face  meeting.  The  HOD/HoSS  will  make  a  written
notation of the discussion for his or her own records to document that the oral warning was given.
Written Warning(s)
If  the  unsatisfactory  performance  continues  or  reoccurs,  the  HOD/HoSS  will  again  discuss  the
problem with the employee and the employee will be given a written warning (in consultation with HR
Head) which will state the nature of the unsatisfactory performance, the improvement expected, and
the  time  frame  in  which  the  improvement  should  occur.  A  copy  of  the  letter  will  be  sent  to  HR
Department and placed in the employee’s personnel file.
 
The employee will be allowed a reasonable period of time to correct the problem as specified in the
written warning. If the problem is one that can be easily corrected, the improvement may be expected
immediately. If the problem is more complex, a longer period may be appropriate.
In the event the behaviour is not corrected or improved it may be necessary to send a more forceful
message  in  the  form  of  a  second  written  warning.  Following  the  completion  of  the  period  of  time
specified  in  the  first  written  warning,  a  second  written  warning  may  occur  if  the  HOD/HoSS  (in
consultation  with  HR  Head)  feels  that  further  improvement  is  necessary.  Again,  a  copy  of  the  letter
should be sent to the HR Dept and placed in the employee’s file.
If  the  employee’s  work  or  conduct  fails  to  improve,  or  where  the  allegation  is  particularly  serious,  a
final  warning  will  be  given  to  the  employee  wa rning  that  any  further  misconduct  will  result  in  a
dismissal with appropriate notice.
An employee can be dismissed without notice on grounds of gross misconduct.
On case to case basis the Management may constitute a disciplinary committee of senior members of
the Organization to investigate and further advise the Management on misconduct/performance and
behavioural issues.
 
Important points:
Disciplinary  matters  will  be  handled  with  as  high  a  degree  of  confidentiality  as  is  practicable,
particularly when the issue is of a sensitive nature.
Disciplinary action will be based on the severity of the violation made by the employee.
Confidential records of disciplinary matters will be kept in the employee’s personnel file

themselves  by    staying  back  late  or  attending  on  extra  Saturdays,  with  their  sole  reward  being  the
satisfaction of having done a good job.
With  our  resources  being  stretched,  it  is  important  to  incentivise  our  personnel  inn  their  efforts  to  meet
client’s requirements so that we remain on the path of continuous improvement.
While  our  technical  personnel  attending  to  ships  have  the  benefit  of  Special  Attendance  Fees  (SAF),  it
has  been  decided  to  introduce  some    sort  of  incentive  for  our  personnel  at  HO,  Powai  and  IRCLASS
personnel  at Cuffe Parade, who stay back in the office or attend extra saturdays to  complete their work.
With this in mind, the following scheme of Incentive payment is proposed for all personnel, technical/non-

7. EMPLOYEE GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL
Purpose
To provide the employees of IRCLASS an easy and readily accessible machinery for prompt disposal of
their day to day grievances.
Meaning
Every  employee  has  certain  expectations,  which  he  thinks  must  be  fulfilled  by  the  organization  he  is
working  for.  When  the  organization  fails  to  do  this  he  develops  a  feeling  of  dissatisfaction.  When  an
employee feels something is unfair in the organization he is said to have a grievance.
 
 
Thus, we can define Grievance Handling as:
‘A  complaint  of  one  or  more  employees  in  respect  of  salary,  allowances,  conditions  of  work  and
interpretation  of  service  stipulations  covering  such  areas  as,  leave,  transfer,  promotion,  seniority,  job
assignment, and termination of service.’
Process Description
If  an  employee  has  a  problem  with  aspects  of  his  work  or  job,  he  /  she  should  get  it  resolved  with
support and guidance of his / her immediate reporting authority / Head of the department. 
If the employee wishes to keep the issue / problem confidential, can discuss the problem with
 
      the concerned HR person directly.
If the decision taken by the HOD or immediate superior is not satisfactory to the employee, an
      employee can escalate the issue/problem to the higher authority (Divisional Head / 
      Regional Manager) and HR team for further Redressal. 
If  the  employee  is  still  dissatisfied  with  the  timeliness  of  response  or  quality  of  the  response,  an
employee can formally register his grievance in the portal named as HR SUPPORT CENTRE and it is
available  under  HR  Arena.  ).  In  this  portal,  an  employee  can  see  the  concerns  updated  by  him/her
along with its status.

XI EXIT
1.RESIGNATION
In case of resignation, the employee must inform in writing by submitting his/her resignation letter, stating the
intention  to  resign  from  the  services  of  the  company.  As  per  the  terms  and  conditions  of  employment,  the
employee  has  to  give  the  notice  period.  If  there  is  a  shortfall  in  the  notice  period,  then  the  shortfall  will  be
recovered from the dues.
 
In case the employee is handling/having any important/incomplete assignment, then the company will relieve
him/her on the successful completion of assignment or end of his/her notice period. Employees, who have
executed any service agreement, indemnity bond, sponsorship for higher education etc. with IRCLASS, have
to ensure that the agreed amount is deposited with the company when resignation letter is submitted.
During the notice period, an employee shall not be eligible for any leave. 
An employee who has resigned or serving his/her notice period shall not 
be eligible for PL and any prior sanctioned PL/Leave shall be revoked. 
 
Any additional leave if taken during his/her notice period, then the same 
shall be adjusted against his/her relieving date. His/her last date of 
working shall be extended by the number of days of leave availed.
2.RETIREMENT
Employees will retire from the services of IRCLASS on attaining the age of 
60 years. Last working day will be the last day of the month in which they 
attain 60 years.
 
However,  on  case  to  case  basis  the  Board  of  Directors  /  Top  Management  can  extend  the  Date  of
Superannuation  and  Retirement  of  experienced  professionals  subject  to  continual  medical  fitness  and  past
performance record of the employee.

3. FULL AND FINAL SETTLEMENT
It will be the responsibility of the employee to hand-over the functional responsibility to the respective RO /
HOD / HoSS well before the last working day. RO / HOD / HoSS forwards the duly filled ‘No Due Certificate”
form to the HR Department. On receiving this, the Payroll Department settles the employee’s account within
15 days from date of receipt of NDC.
 
If  the  employee  has  not  served  the  Company  for  the  whole  financial  year  and  has  taken  Leave  Travel
Assistance, Medical Reimbursement etc., for the full year, then he/she will be paid on pro-rata basis for the
period  of  his/her  service  during  the  year  in  question.  However,  in  case  of  retirement  or  an  unfortunate
demise,  no  recovery  will  be  made.  The  excess  amount  paid  by  IRCLASS  will  be  recovered  during  the  full
and final settlement of the employee.
 
4. EXIT INTERVIEWS
Once  the  resignation  letter  is  received,  HR  representative  conducts  the  exit  interview  with  the  concerned
employee.  The  main  objective  of  holding  an  exit  interview  is  to  know  the  reason/s  why  the  employee  has
decided  to  resign  from  the  services  of  the  Company  and  seek  employment  elsewhere.  In  case  of  an
employee from Survey Station, the concerned HoSS conducts the exit interview.
The information collected from the exit interview is kept confidential.
 
If something is bothering an employee:
If  something  is  bothering  an  employee,  he/she  sho uld  not  hesitate  to  discuss  the  matter  with  his/her
reporting  officer  or  HRD  on  confidential  basis.  Since  the  Reporting  Officer  is  the  person  who  understands
his/her subordinate better, it is recommended that he/she approach his/her Reporting Officer first.
 
P.S.:  All  reimbursements  are  at  the  discretion  of  the  management  and  it  cannot  be  claimed  as  a  matter  of
right and would always be subject to the prevailing laws of the land. For any clarifications, HR Dept may be
consulted.
Disclaimer: The purpose of Indian Register of Shipping (IRClass) Employee Information Handbook (EIH) is
to bring together in a convenient place a summary of some of the policies that affect employees. Employees
should read this handbook and become familiar with the content. Employees should be comfortable referring
to  the  handbook  whenever  a  question  regarding  employment  with  the  Company  arises.  However,  the
handbook  will  not  answer  all  of  the  questions  employees  may  have  about  Company  policies  or  benefits.  If
the  handbook  does  not  answer  the  question,  employees  can  contact  their  HOD/HoSS  or  HR  Dept  for
assistance.  The  handbook  revokes  and  supersedes  any  prior  summaries  or  statements  of  employment
policies and procedures. We expect to revise and update this handbook from time to time.
